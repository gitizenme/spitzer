# Overview

On January 30th 2020, NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope will complete its mission. My involvement with the mission was as a Software Engineer at Caltech working on the Uplink and Archive subsystems from 1998 to 2007.

Spitzer Gallery is a mobile application for Apple and Android devices.

The Spitzer Gallery provides a gallery of images generated by the telescope over the mission lifetime.

The Spitzer Space Telescope is the final mission in NASA’s Great Observatories Program – a family of four space-based observatories, each observing the Universe in a different kind of light. The other missions in the program include the visible-light Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO), and the Chandra X-Ray Observatory (CXO).Spitzer is designed to detect infrared radiation, which is primarily heat radiation.

The application is developed under the MIT open source license and host on GitHub https://github.com/gitizenme/spitzer, contributions are welcome!

The Spitzer Space Telescope is a NASA mission managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Image and media for this app created by the Spitzer Science Center, located at IPAC on the campus of California Institute of Technology.
